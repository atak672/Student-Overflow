        <p class = "paragraph"> <b>Student Overflow</b> was formed to help alleviate the overcrowding of Computer Science departments and courses through peer-led academic support at Duke University.</p>
      </p>

      
      <p class="paragraph">In courses with 400+ students, it can be challenging to find quality help due to limited office hours and a low staff-to-student ratio. We aim to expand the assistance that Teaching Assistants can provide by offering virtual office hours and one-on-one tutoring sessions, helping students get the guidance they need.</p>
      
      <p class="paragraph">If you have any questions or are interested in applying to be a tutor, please visit the Contact Us page. In your message, make the subject "Application" and include basic information: name, year in school, major, and field of expertise. We look forward to starting the process with you!</p>
    
      <p class = "paragraph"><b>Join us for office hours</b>, Monday–Friday, 6 PM–9 PM. Please go to the "Office Hours" tab for access.</p>
